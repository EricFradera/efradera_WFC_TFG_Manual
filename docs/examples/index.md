# Examples

## Super Mario

This demo tries to showcase both the one-dimensional topology and the configuration through manual relationships. One dimensional topology are very simple so manual configurations feels very natural and visual. In the case of this Mario level, we can create a visually consistent level that is also controlled in the game design department. The designer can create sections by linking them with a relation to give the user with controlled wise difficulty sections. In a sectional new mechanic can be introduced and provide multiple versions for increased variety.

## Wang Tiles

A few examples have been followed to show that this tool cover all tile possibilities under the rules proposed by Hao Wang.

##  Corner tiles

2 corner tiles are very useful to texturize terrains in a procedural way. In the first pic we can see a very cartoon and visual configuration, by changing this very defined version by texture with more noise and more diffuse, we are able to create very convincing textures with just 6 samples.

## Blob tiles

Blob tiles are great to use for dungeon creation. The dungeons can easily be transformed into 3d environments. The use of frequency is an invaluable tool in with these types of tiles, by increasing the amount of floor level we can obtain bigger rooms while increasing corridor tile will make corridors be longer and make rooms far from each other.

## Oksar stalberg demo

Oskar stalberg has been a referent in the wave function community. This demo is a great example of landscapes and structures that can be created. Both terrain and decoration such as buildings can be done easily.

## Carcassone

Carcassone is a tabletop game that uses Wang tiles and illustrates the possibility on city generation when used properly as shown in the figure XX-

## Rotation demo

This demo showcases the use of full 2d rotations and how with just a simple sample as a texture, and a few rotations a lot of patterns can be created as the example below. Rotations are invaluable to make configurations a fast and easy to understand.

## Pipes 3d

Pipes 3d showcases the capability to create complex system using wfc. Pipes 3d also showcases rotations made on 3d. Pipes are symmetrical 3d tiles which makes them perfect for a rotation demo. The input of the demo only requires 4 3d models to work completely. Then the user can add the rotations at will. Playing with both the frequency and the rotation of every tile creates surprising and very interesting results.

## Camping

The camping demo showcases a few features. First it uses 3d topology to create terrains with different heights no longer constrain to a single plane. Then, it uses the check randomize between variables which allows to spawn decoration elements in available spaces randomly. In this demo it spawns from trees, to grass to tents to fill the terrain. With the frequency variable the number of objects can be tuned and fill environments in a more natural way.
